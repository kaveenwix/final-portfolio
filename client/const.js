      "One challenge I encountered during this project was establishing a clear and cohesive theme. To make the design stand out and feel intentional, I leaned into the use of bold, strategic pops of color. These accents help draw attention to key images and text elements, guiding the viewer’s eye and creating visual interest without overwhelming the layout.The magazine centers around current MVP and 2025 NBA Champion Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, spotlighting his historic rise in the league. From his standout performances to his cultural influence, the piece captures the essence of a player who is not only dominating the court but also shaping the future of the NBA.",
    why: "This long document was a personal challenge where I set out to blend my passion with the work I produce. It pushed me to find a meaningful connection between what I love and how I design. I'm proud of how it turned out — from the concept to the final layout — and I believe the overall design reflects both my creativity and dedication.",
