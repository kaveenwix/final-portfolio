      "For this redesign of LinkedIn’s mobile app, I began by analyzing the existing interface to identify usability challenges and opportunities for improvement. I then developed user personas to understand the needs and behaviors of typical users. Using these insights, I created low-fidelity wireframes to experiment with layouts and navigation. After refining the structure, I designed high-fidelity mockups in Figma, focusing on simplifying the UI and enhancing visual hierarchy. To validate the design, I built an interactive prototype and conducted usability testing, gathering feedback that informed final iterations to improve clarity, accessibility, and overall user experience.",
